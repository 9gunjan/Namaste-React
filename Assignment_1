Q. What is Emmet ?

-Think of Emmet as shorthand. With it, you can easily write a lot of code quickly. It dramatically speeds up your HTML & CSS workflow. Understanding how to use Emmet is literally a superpower.
-With Emmet you can quickly create an HTML boilerplate in the blink of an eye. In an HTML file, simply type ! and you’ll see that Emmet has popped up as a suggestion. Now hit Enter. There you have it, a basic, blank HTML web page ready to go.
-Not just HTML boiler plate but other stuff like css , and other basic tags also.
Examples- Try typing: div then Enter
                      h1 Enter
                      p Enter
                      bq for a <blockquote>
                      hdr for a <header>
                      ftr for a <footer>
                      btn for a <button> etc etc..

Q. Difference between a Library and Framework? 

--LIBRARY--

-Library is like building your home from the ground up. The house can be made in any style you prefer and the rooms can be arranged and decorated however you like.
-A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks. The term library simply refers to a collection of code that is reused repeatedly. It is essentially a set of pre-defined functions and classes that programmers can use to simplify their work and speed up the development process. So, developers do not have to write code to accomplish specific functionality because the library already includes code for those functionalities. Standard libraries are available with most programming languages, but programmers can also make their own custom libraries.

--FRAMEWORK--  

-Framework, on the other hand, is like buying a new home. The house is already built, so you don’t have to worry about building problems, but you can’t choose how the rooms are arranged.
-Developers need not start from scratch when they have tools to assist them like Frameworks. A framework is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms. It includes reusable pieces of code written to perform common tasks and uses code provided by a developer for custom functionality. The framework may include defined and undefined objects and functions that developers can use to create applications. In that way, we can add significant functionality to the system by using existing code around the structure. 

-In developing applications, libraries and frameworks play a key role. Essentially, both the library and the Framework are reusable pieces of code written by developers to solve complicated problems. What differentiates the two terms is “Who’s calling whom”. 

--KEY DIFFERENCE--

Put simply, the “Inversion of Control” (IoC) describes the difference between a library and a framework. In some ways, you can think of a framework as a collection of libraries, but it’s entirely different. By using a library, you control the flow of the program. The library can be invoked whenever and wherever you like. Contrary to this, when you use a framework, the flow is controlled by the framework. The framework instructs you where to put your code, but it will call your code as required. Simply put, our code calls the library’s code, but in a framework, it’s the framework’s code that calls our code

Q. What is CDN? Why do we use it?

- A CDN is a content delivery network. It is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location.
- CDNs are used to improve website performance by reducing latency and providing a more reliable connection.

CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a wiser choice when you are just starting with React or have a pre-built website and need to include React Components. As you know, CDNs are handy, and they require minimal setup. They help you get your work started in fewer lines of code. ReactJs CDN is a popular CDN available on React Ecosystem, which allows you to get all the features of ReactJs in your project, especially when you are a beginner. There are many values that ReactJs CDN adds to your work: 
-You get to use as little ReactJS as possible without setting up the boilerplate.
-React CDN is so simple that you even can use only a simple React Component for interactivity.

Q. Why is React known as React?

React is named React because of its ability to react to changes in data. When the data in a React component changes, React will automatically re-render the component so that it reflects the new data. This makes it easy to create performant user interfaces that always look up-to-date.
React is called React because it was designed to be a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The name "React" was chosen because the library was designed to allow developers to "react" to changes in state and data within an application, and to update the user interface in a declarative and efficient manner.

Q. What is crossorigin in script tag?

The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.

Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.

A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain. It defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. CORS allows servers to specify who can access the assets on the server, among many other things.

Q. What is diference between React and ReactDOM ?

The reason React and ReactDOM were split into two libraries was due to the arrival of React Native. React contains functionality utilised in web and mobile apps. ReactDOM functionality is utilised only in web apps.
React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces and ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM.
To sum up:
React is the main thing which is divided into React-Dom and React-Native which is for web and Mobile respectively.

Q. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

-The very basic difference is that Production Build has ugly, minified(compressed) version of your javascript code, so this makes rendering of file on end user's browser very quick and performance enhancing.
-Development mode includes useful warnings and gives you access to tools that make development and debugging easier. Production mode minifies your code and better represents the performance your app will have on end users' devices.
